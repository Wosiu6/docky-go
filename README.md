docky-go:= cli_container_visualisation
==========

The goal of this application is to eventually display your container stats in a fancy looking cli visualisation scenario, for now it just displays your container stats in line.

## Status
This repo is very much a work in progress and a way for me to learn Golang.

## Wanna see it in action?
Mind you, this is probably going to change a lot but here is what I have so far:

## Contribution
It is unlikely I will accept any contribution right now because this is a project I want to get to a state I am happy with myself for now.
Feel free to reach out anyway if you have any questions or suggestions!
