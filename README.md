# docky-go:= cli_container_visualisation
==========

[![License][license-shield]][license-url] [![GitHub][github-shield]][github-url]

The goal of this application is to eventually display your container stats in a fancy looking cli visualisation scenario, for now it just displays your container stats in line.

## Status
This repo is very much a work in progress and a way for me to learn Golang.

## Contribution
It is unlikely I will accept any contribution right now because this is a project I want to get to a state I am happy with myself for now.
Feel free to reach out anyway if you have any questions or suggestions!
